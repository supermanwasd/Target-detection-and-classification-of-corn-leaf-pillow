The detection and classification of corn leaf pillows based on the SSD model combines machine vision technology in computer technology with agricultural experiments to develop a usable agricultural experiment target detection model. The model in this experiment uses the Tensorflow object detection API framework as the basis for training and detection. The model trained in the framework can be transplanted to Android and IOS platforms and can be used on the mobile terminal conveniently. The ssdlite_mobilenet_v2 model is a mild neural network. The structure does not require high computing performance, so it can theoretically be used on any mobile device introduced in recent years, which increases the mobility of the model and makes field detection of machine vision technology a reality.
